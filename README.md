## Collaboration
### Github
1. Always work on your own branches.
2. Name branches with `yourname-taskname` (all lowercase). Task name should be concise and no more than 3 words. For
 example, if Doge is working on setting up Docker, then `doge-docker-setup` would be a nice branch name.
3. When you're ready to get your code reviewed, create a pull request and inform your reviewer via Slack.
